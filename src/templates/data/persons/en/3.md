## Carl Blegen,

worked on the excavation of Troy 1932–1938 годах

Carl Blegen was born in Minnesota to a professor and a prominent figure in the Norwegian Lutheran Church. He studied at Yale University, then became a professor of classical archaeology at the University of Cincinnati.

Blegen worked extensively in Greece and was a fellow of the American School for Classical Studies in Athens. In 1965 he was the first to receive a gold medal from the American School in recognition of his achievements in archaeology.

Blegen conducted research at Troy with the University of Cincinnati from 1932-1938. He divided the main periods of Troy into more fractured ones and established that the Homeric epic speaks of the city of VIIa (Troy VIIa). The result of this work was the famous book "Troy and the Trojans", 1963.

In 1939 and from 1952 to 1966, Blegen explored the palace of Nestorius in Pylos. This was the most important work of his archaeological career. Its results were published in "The Palace of Nestor at Pylos in Western Messinia" (1966-1973). Blegen studied a very interesting variant of Mycenaean culture and discovered a large complex (several hundred) of clay tablets with Linear B script. These tablets helped to test Michael Ventris' version of the deciphering of Linear B script.
