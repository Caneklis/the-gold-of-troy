## Manfred Korfmann, worked on the excavation of Troy 1988–2005 годах

Manfred Korfmann was born in Germany. He was a professor at the Institute of Prehistory and Ancient History at the University of Tübingen.

In 1988, Korfmann obtained exclusive permission to excavate Troy. An international team of many people and institutions was established. A working group from Tübingen was responsible for prehistory and early history, a team from the University of Cincinnati studied the classical period. A thorough study of Hissarlik Hill resulted in the clarification of the chronology of Troy. Korfmann also discovered the lower city and found that Troy at the end of the Bronze Age occupied an area 15 times larger than previously thought. In addition, he discovered the most ancient period of the city's development - the Troy 0 layer - which made it possible to confirm that Troy had existed since the middle of the 4th millennium B.C.

In 1996, Korfmann helped to establish a historical national park on the castle mound, which was later included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. In 2001-2002 he initiated a major exhibition in Stuttgart entitled "Troia: Traum und Wirklichkeit" ("Troy: Dream and Reality").
