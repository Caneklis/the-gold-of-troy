Rüstem Aslan, worked on the excavation of Troy from 2014

Since 2014, the study of Troy has been led by Rustem Aslan, Professor of Archaeology at Çanakkale University.

Aslan has worked for several years on an expedition led by Manfred Korfmann. He is currently continuing his research into the oldest layer, Troy 0, and is also seeking to identify the location of the ancient Bronze Age necropolis of Troy.

In 2018, the Troy Museum was opened within the historic park. It exhibits finds from Troy and its environs, which includes objects from the 'Trojan Gold' purchased for the University of Pennsylvania in 1966, given to the museum for long-term storage.

Aslan is a supporter of the idea of transferring all the finds made in Troy since its exploration and now preserved in 44 museums around the world to the new museum. In particular, he said this at a conference marking the opening of the "Troy: Myth and Reality" exhibition at the British Museum in 2019.
